# `{unhcrverse}` - **Data Analysis: From common challenges to a "solution community"**!

*`{unhcrverse}`* is an organisation account on Github  to promote the usage of R data language. It allows to coordinate dissemination and reviews of templates, packages and projects.


## A selection of Tools...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> *Having a project within __`{unhcrverse}`__ is not only a recognition and an opportunity to showcase the work but also a way to request and benefit from peer review from all R-users within UNHCR.*

### Packages that are *Stable-enough*
The list of mature projects includes [set of packages](articles/ecosystem.html) to ease the production of statistical evidence and data stories. Those **Packages** should aim to reach over time the standards outlined in the [CRAN policies](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html).

```
install.packages("pak")  

pak::pkg_install("unhcRverse/unhcRverse")  

unhcrverse::unhcrverse()  

```

### Deprecated packages
Any project from `{unhcrverse}` that has pending bug reports for some time but where there is no Core developers working with UNHCR anymore to fix them will be labelled as deprecated. This list includes for instance now [koboloader](https://unhcr.github.io/koboloadeR/docs/) and [unhcrstyle](https://unhcr-web.github.io/unhcRstyle/docs/)

### Showcase projects
Any project can be submitted to be referenced in the [unhcrverse showcase](articles/showcase.html). Community members will provide feedback through discussion in the [issue system](https://github.com/unhcRverse/unhcRverse/issues) and inline with [coding style conventions](articles/codingstyle.html).

## ...Made by and for People...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> *Not all R-users need to know how to code! Any package can also be delivered with a graphical user interface*

### at first, **Users**
Typical users are Information Management Officer, Data Analyst, Consultant or Economist working within UNHCR Operations. They are the most important members of the community.

### that can become **Contributors**
Contributors interact with the project on GitHub by filing new issues, improving existing issues, or submitting pull requests. Anyone can become a contributor, the only obligation is to follow the [code of conduct](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html).

### with a few project Project Maintainers
The project maintainer is responsible for initially submitting the project on **`{unhcrverse}`**. S/He shall then communicate on the strategic objectives of the project and maintain the documentation. Packages are developed on personal github account and pull request should be made to the forked version of the project on `{unhcrverse}`. Project maintainers shall aim to work when possible with other **core developers** (for instance project maintainers of other packages within `{unhcrverse}`).

## ...organised as a  Community

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> *If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together...*

### nudged by a **coordinator**
The Community coordinator is responsible for presenting and promoting the **`{unhcrverse}`** in all conference, meetings and discussions and through project related GitHub issues discussion of pull request within **`{unhcrverse}`**. This include the maintenance of the **`{unhcrverse}`** Github admin team.

The coordinator also organizes meetings with all maintainer in order to agree on the project to be included/classified in the organisation repository. Last function is around advocating for funding in order to support potential third-party code review on the projects and presential developer conference organisation.

### supporting **strategic decision making**
This organisation account on github is managed jointly by the different Project Maintainers and follows some [coordination principles](articles/coordination.html).

As for [tidyVerse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), `{unhcrverse}` community makes decisions according to a consensus model where suggestions are considered and discussed between the community coordinator, project maintainers and core developers, typically in GitHub issues.
