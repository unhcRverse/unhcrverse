  * Server Logic
  * Reactive Elements
  * Deployment
  * Advanced Topics
  * Conclusion

---

## Introduction to Shiny
What is Shiny?

  * Shiny is an R package for building interactive web applications.
  * Allows you to turn your R code into interactive web apps without the need for web development skills.

Why Shiny?

  * Data visualization
  * Data exploration
  * Interactive reporting
  * Dashboards

---

## Shiny App Components

Every Shiny app consists of few main components:

 *  User Interface (UI) defines the app's appearance and layout.
 *  Server Logic defines the app's behavior and data processing.
 *  Style Defined through CSS.
 *  Client side interaction defined with Javascript.

---

## User Interface (UI) Elements

  * UI is defined using a set of elements like fluidPage, sidebarLayout, and widgets.
  * These elements structure the layout and interaction of your app.

Example UI

```  

# Define UI structure
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("My Shiny App"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      # Input widgets
    ),
    mainPanel(
      # Output elements
    )
  )
)
``` 

---

## Server Logic  Function

  * The server function is where you define the app's logic.
  * It reacts to user inputs and generates outputs.

Example Server Logic

``` 
# Define server logic
server <- function(input, output) {
  # Reactive expressions and outputs
}
``` 

---

## Reactive Elements  Expressions

  * Reactive expressions are used to compute outputs based on inputs.
  * They ensure that your app responds to user interactions in real-time.

Example Reactive Expression

``` 
# Define a reactive expression
output$plot <- renderPlot({
  # Code to generate a plot based on input
})
``` 

---

## Deployment Options

  * Shiny apps can be deployed locally or on the web.
  * Options include Shiny Server, Shinyapps.io, and RStudio Connect.

Deploying Locally

  * Use shiny::runApp() to run your app locally.

 
---

## Shiny Modules

  * Modularize your app by creating Shiny modules for reusability.
  
  
---

## What is Golem?

  * Golem is an opinionated Shiny framework that promotes structured app development.
  * It enforces best practices for code organization, modularization, and scalability.
  * Golem is designed for large-scale, production-ready Shiny apps.

Golem Features

  * Robust app structure
  * Automated testing
  * Modular app design
  * Code validation

---

## Benefits of Using Golem
 

  * Improved code organization
  * Easier maintenance and collaboration
  * Built-in testing for quality assurance
  * Scalability for large projects
  * Community-driven development

---

## Creating a Golem Application 

  * Use the golem::create_golem() function to set up a new Golem application.
  * Golem creates a project structure with pre-configured files and folders.

Example

``` 
# Create a new Golem app
golem::create_golem(path = "my_golem_app")
``` 

---

## Golem Project Structure

  * Golem enforces a structured project layout.
  * Key directories include R, inst, tests, man, and app.

Example Structure

``` 
my_golem_app/
|-- DESCRIPTION
|-- NAMESPACE
|-- app/
|-- R/
|-- inst/
|-- tests/
|-- ...
``` 

---

## Modules and Testing 

  * Golem promotes modular design by separating app components into modules.
  * Modules are self-contained and can be reused in different parts of the app.

Automated Testing

  * Golem provides automated testing using testthat.
  * Ensure app reliability with unit tests.

---

## Deployment and Maintenance
Deployment Options

  * Deploy your Golem app locally or to Shinyapps.io, Docker, or other platforms.
  * Golem includes deployment scripts.

Maintenance

  * Golem apps are easier to maintain due to their organized structure.
  * Continuous development and maintenance are supported.


---

## Key Takeaways

  * Shiny allows you to create interactive web apps with R.
  * Apps have a UI structure and server logic.
  * Reactive elements enable real-time interactivity.
  * Deployment options include local and web-based.
  * Golem is a powerful framework for structured Shiny app development.
  * It enforces best practices, modularity, and automated testing.
  * Use Golem for large-scale and production-ready Shiny apps.
  * Explore advanced features for customization.
